How to use this program:

Move with WASD or the arrow keys
Shoot with space NOTE: there is a bug where the bullet will not always appear on screen. Try holding down an arrow key and pressing space
and a bullet will spawn and fly off in that direction

I do not have a functioning physics engine (hence the lack of gravity or jump logic)

all image assets were made by me

WHAT I DID NOT GET WORKING:
- I encountered issues trying to spawn enemies at different locations on the map. They will always spawn at the first spawn point
- I had difficulty getting the advanced enemies to take two hits instead of one
