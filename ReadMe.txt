How to use this program:

Move with WASD or the arrow keys
Shoot with space NOTE: there is a bug where the bullet will not always appear on screen. Try holding down an arrow key and pressing space
and a bullet will spawn and fly off in that direction

I do not have a functioning physics engine (hence the lack of gravity or jump logic)
